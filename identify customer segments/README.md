# customer_segmentation
Customer Segmentation Project from Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

## Summary and Motivation

The purpose of this project was to employ clustering and feature selection and engineering on a real-world
general population dataset and then apply the same techniques to customer data in order to gain insight about
the customers.

The motivation for this project is to satisfy requirements for Term 1 of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree,
as well as to practice and demonstrate clustering techniques.
